# GP-Prantner-Stoering
I created this repo on my local account, as I was getting errors everytime I tried to use the provided class material.
We will complete the assignment and submit our personal repo. This should satisfy the requirements of the project,
even though will not be completing through the SCC Teams section. I have been moving to a new home this week so this
project has been harder to fit into my schedule than I anticipated. Thank you for the patience Wendy :)
